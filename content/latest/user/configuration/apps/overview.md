# Apps
{{< hint info >}}
ðŸ’¡ You can replace the default values of the commands for `PROJECT`, `STAGE` and `APPNAME` in the form on the right side! A standard pattern might be `myproject`, `production` and `web` (see [concepts]({{< relref "/latest/user/concepts" >}})).
{{< /hint >}}

An **App** is a task that the SetOps platform runs. A stage may have many Apps. Apps are always assumed
to be long-running. Each of these containers are called a **Task**. For example, web applications
will usually have a task named `web` for the application server, and possibly a task named `job` for running background jobs. Apps are assumed to be stateless â€“ they persist user data by accessing services.

Let's create an app named `<APPNAME>` on the stage `<STAGE>` with `app:create <APPNAME>`:

```shell
setops -p <PROJECT> -s <STAGE> app:create <APPNAME>
```

{{< hint info >}}
The name for apps must only contain lowercase letters `a-z` and numbers `0-9` and dashes `-`. The name must be between 3 and 16 characters long and start with a lowercase letter.
{{< /hint >}}

Note that your new app `<APPNAME>` doesn't show up when you run `app`:

```shell
setops -p <PROJECT> -s <STAGE> app
```
```
+------+
| NAME |
+------+
+------+
```

The reason for this is that the `app:create` command did not change anything immediately. It was added to your current Changeset instead. Commands such as `app` or `info` always display the view of your stage the last time anyone successfully committed a changeset.

Run `setops -p <PROJECT> -s <STAGE> changeset:commit` to commit the Changeset.

## Configuration Overview

An App can be configured with the following parameters. Newly created Apps are initialized with the indicated defaults.

These parameters are grouped into the following configuration topics:

- `container`
- `network`
- `resources`
- `env`
- `domains`

| Command                                                                                                     | Subcommand | Valid Values | Default | Description |

| [Port]({{< relref "/latest/user/configuration/apps/network#port" >}})                                       | `set` | `1..65535` | `5000` | Defines a custom port the application listens to internally. |
| [Network Health Check]({{< relref "/latest/user/configuration/apps/network#network-health-check" >}})       | `set`, `unset` | see paragraph | - | Defines how the health of the App will be checked. |
| **Resource**                                                                                                |

To perform these configurations, you can refer to the following sections.

{{< hint warning >}}
Please note, that, like the creation of an App, also changes in the configuration of an App are added to a changeset
and have to be committed in order to become live. You will not be able to see your changes e.g. in
`app:info <APPNAME>` directly unless you commit them with `changeset:commit`.
{{< /hint >}}

```shell
# Example: Add a command to an existing app

# Set a command to an existing app
setops -p <PROJECT> -s <STAGE> --app <APPNAME> container:set command -- bundle exec puma -b tcp://127.0.0.1:9292
Name:      <APPNAME>
Command:   [bundle exec puma -b tcp://127.0.0.1:9292]

# app:info does not list the change yet, since they are not committed
setops -p <PROJECT> -s <STAGE> app:info <APPNAME>
Name:      <APPNAME>
Command:   []

# Commit the current changeset
setops -p <PROJECT> -s <STAGE> changeset:commit

# Now app:info shows the changes made
