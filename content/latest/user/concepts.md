# Concepts

The most important concepts you need to know about to use SetOps efficiently are **Organizations**, **Projects**, **Stages**, **Apps**, **Services**, **Changesets**, and its CLI.

## Organization

An **Organization** is the topmost organizational entity in SetOps. It can host multiple Projects and is bound to an AWS account.

## Project

A **Project** acts as a namespace for your application. It has a unique name, i.e. *myproject*, and stages are nested under a project.

## Stage

A **Stage** a self-contained deployment environment. It is tied to a project and has a unique name, i.e. *staging* or *production*. A given stage is completely isolated from all other stages, which means that it does not share any resources or data with them.

## App

An **App** is a task that the SetOps platform runs. A stage may have many apps. Apps are always assumed
to be long-running. They run on our container-based platform using an image you provide. For example, web applications
will usually have a task named `web` for the application server and possibly a task called `job` for running background jobs. Apps are assumed to be stateless. They persist user data by accessing services.

## Service

A **Service** is an additional component such as databases, for example. Services provide additional functionality and can be linked to apps that consume them.

## Changeset

A **Changeset** is a set of commands which change a stage. The SetOps workflow for changing anything on a stage always works the same: you add a set of commands to your changeset and commit it to make your change live (or discard the changeset). Changesets work just like the Git staging area in your local repository: you add some files, then you commit.

Changesets are stored on the server per stage and user. So a user can log in from multiple computers and edit the stored changeset and commit or discard it.


## Example

![SetOps Concepts Example](concepts.png)

In this example, there is a Stage with one App _web_ and two Services, _database_, and _store_. Let's say we want to create another App. This is done with a Changeset that contains a Command to create the App and set its Scale to _2_. When the Changeset is committed, the Stage has the two Apps _web_ and _worker_ with the Services _database_ and _store_.


## CLI

The Command Line Interface (CLI) is the heart of SetOps. You can create, configure, deploy and manage your application with this single tool. The CLI commands follow a consistent and intuitive pattern.

There are:

- commands
- subcommands
- scope flags
- arguments

We separate commands from subcommands with a `:`. The scope flags have the same name as the belonging commands and define the scope for a lower-level command.

The following examples explain commands, subcommands, scope flags, and arguments:

```
setops --scope-flag command:subcomand argument

setops project:create myproject
setops --project myproject stage:create production
setops --project myproject --stage production app:create web
setops --project myproject --stage production --app web container:set port 3000
```
The command hierarchy looks like following:

```
setops
└─ project
     └─ stage
         ├─ app
             ├─ container
                 ├─ set
                 └─ unset
             ├─ network
             ├─ resource
             ├─ env
             ├─ domain
             ├─ task
             └─ log
         ├─ service
             ├─ link
             ├─ backup
             └─ option
         ├─ notification
         ├─ changeset
         └─ user
             ├─ invite
             └─ remove
```

The CLI nests every lower-level command with a scope flag. For example, let's take a look at the `container` command: It is nested below `setops` → `project` → `stage` → `app`. So to use `container:set`, you need to provide the following scope flags for this lower-level command:
```
setops --project myproject --stage production --app web container:set ARGUMENT
```

You can set all flags either in front or after the command; for better readability of our documentation, we place scope flags at the start of the command.

This is a list of common subcommands:

- `create`
- `destroy`
- `info`
- `set`
- `unset`
- `commit`
- `discard`

We use these terms consistently for any resource: it is `app:create`, `app:destroy`, `service:create`, and `service:destroy`.

A command without a colon-separated subcommand is the list command, returning a list of all resources of this type.
